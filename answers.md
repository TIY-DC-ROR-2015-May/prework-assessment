1.  Done 

2.  I have only directories and hidden files in my home dir on my computer.  They are:  
./                                              .enstaller4rc                                   .rbenv/                                         Google Drive/

I know this by doing:
$ cd ~
$ ls -a (so I get the hidden files as well as)


3.  In dir 3 there are 40 files.  gunner-lind.txt contains a number : 5548767243.  To determine this I did the following:
$ cd TIY/prework-assessment/3
$ sublime gunner-lind.txt

4.  Completed in line inside 4.rb

5.  Program written in a file called 5.rb

6.  Commpleted in line inside 6.rb (I made an alternative, because I originally implemented the shared_interests_with method in a different way and during debugging I found a better way so I kept this one as a backup/alternate solution)
