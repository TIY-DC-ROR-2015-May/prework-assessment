# Prework Assessment

This is a collection of exercises to make sure that you have internalized key concepts from [the prework](https://github.com/TIY-DC-ROR-2015-May/course-notes/blob/master/prework.md).

# Exercises

1. Clone this repository, using the *SSH* clone URL
2. What files are in your home directory? How did you determine that?
3. Navigate into the `3` directory. How many files are there? What is in the `gunner-lind.txt` file? What commands did you use to determine those? (You may be interested to read the `populate_directory.rb` file to see how these were generated.)
4. `4.rb` contains the start of a text analysis program. Complete it, following the included comments.
5. Write a program that asks the user to type a sentence and sorts it (so `if you type this` becomes `   efhiiopsttuyy`).
6. `6.rb` contains the start of a very rough social network. Flesh it out, following the outline and comments.

# If you're struggling ...

don't panic. I expect some of these to be difficult for those of you with no exposure to Ruby besides the CodeAcademy work, especially given time constraints. If you're getting started and engaging with the problems, you should be fine. But if you have no idea where to start (or which CodeAcademy section to compare to for reference), do take some extra time to go back and review (or to thumb through another introductory [resource](https://github.com/theironyard/rb-assignments/wiki/Resources)).

If you're having trouble specifically with git or Github, feel free to send me what you have in an email or as a link to a [gist](https://gist.github.com/).
